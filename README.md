# Visualization for Analytics_SAS

## Project Overview  

I assumed the role of an analyst at a prestigious healthcare consulting company and carried out a short-term project. The organization, a major hospital chain, collects data on patients receiving treatment within their hospitals on a regular basis. However, due to the lack of appropriate analytical solutions and a shortage of skilled medical analysts, the scientific team encountered challenges in extracting meaningful insights from this valuable data.
My role in this project was to assist the scientists in analyzing the patient data and providing crucial information to the medical research team. To begin, I meticulously investigated a curated list of hypotheses and utilized the powerful SAS Viya for Learners platform to analyze the provided HEART dataset. My mission in this project was to analyze the data, generate insightful results through visualization, and present them in a comprehensive report.

## Project Description  

As part of the coursework for dnsc 6323, I assumed the role of an analyst at a healthcare consulting firm, where I delivered analytical solutions to clients within a large hospital chain. Leveraging patient data, specifically focusing on individuals with heart disease, I conducted a thorough analysis to test a set of hypotheses. This analysis was performed utilizing the SAS Viya for Learners platform.

## Tested Hypotheses:  
* H1: The weight and cholesterol levels are correlated
* H2: Men are usually more obese than women
* H3: Women usually smoke less than men, but their cholesterol level is higher
* H4: The blood pressure is higher for people with higher cholesterol levels
* In addition, providing some distinctive characteristics for people who suffered from coronary heart disease and make some assumptions regarding the potential underlying causes of this illness.

## Tool used:  
[SAS (SAS Viya Learners platform)](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya-for-learners.html)

## Process:  
1) Accessed SAS Viya for Learners platform and accessed HEART data source 
2) Explored and analyzed the HEART data set
3) Did Experiments with different analytical models to identify important insights
