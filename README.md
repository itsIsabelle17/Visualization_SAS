# Visualization for Analytics_SAS

## Instruction
You are an analyst at a health care consulting company and your new client is a large hospital chain. This institution collects, on a regular basis, data about patients that received treatment in one of their hospitals, but due to lack of appropriate analytical solutions and a shortage of qualified medical analysts, the scientists could not make significant progress in obtaining useful insights. As part of the engagement, you are assigned the role to assist the scientists in analyzing the data about the patients and provide information to the medical research team. The scientists from the research institution have a list they would like to test using the existing patient data. It is based on the theories and findings from the latest medical literature. The team has shared data on patients with heart disease (the HEART data set up on the SAS Viya for Learners platform) and you should test with great insights.

## Description of the project
As one of the exercises I did in course dnsc 6323, I became an analyst for a health care consulting firm and provided an analytic solution for data to my clients, a large hospital chain. Using existing patient data for a list of hypotheses to produce results. The data is about patients with heart disease (heart data set up on the SAS Viya for Learners platform).

## Tested Hypotheses:
* H1: The weight and cholesterol levels are correlated
* H2: Men are usually more obese than women
* H3: Women usually smoke less than men, but their cholesterol level is higher
* H4: The blood pressure is higher for people with higher cholesterol levels
* In addition, providing some distinctive characteristics for people who suffered from coronary heart disease and make some assumptions regarding the potential underlying causes of this illness.

## Tool used: [SAS (SAS Viya Learners platform)](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya-for-learners.html)

## Process:
1) Accessed SAS Viya for Learners platform and accessed HEART data source 
2) Explored and analyzed the HEART data set
3) Did Experiments with different analytical models to identify important insights
